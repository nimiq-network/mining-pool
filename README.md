# Nimiq Mining-Pool Server
This mining pool server combines resources of multiple clients mining on the Nimiq blockchain.
Clients are independent network nodes and generate or validate blocks themselves to support decentralization.
Details about the mining pool protocol can be found [here](https://nimiq-network.github.io/developer-reference/chapters/pool-protocol.html#mining-pool-protocol).
A mining pool client is implemented in [Nimiq Core](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core/tree/master/src/main/generic/miner).

**Operating a public mining-pool in the mainnet makes you responsible for other people's money. Test your pool setup in the testnet first!**

## Architecture
The pool server consists of three parts which communicate through a common MySQL-compatible database (schema see `sql/create.sql`)
* The pool **server** interacts with clients and verifies their shares. There can be multiple pool server instances.
* The pool **service** computes client rewards using a PPLNS reward system.
* The pool **payout** processes automatic payouts above a certain user balance and payout requests.

While the server(s) and the service are designed to run continuously, the pool payout has to be executed whenever a payout is desired.

## Run
Run `node index.js --config=[CONFIG_FILE]`. See `[server|service|payout].sample.conf` for sample configuration files and clarifications.

## Custom Behavior
The pool server supports custom behaviors through the optional `eventHandlers.js` file. Code written here
will be run every time a specific event occurs. The currently supported events are:

* **beforeRegister** - Called on a *server* configuration when a register message is received, before
    setting up the `PoolAgent`.
* **onRegister** - Called on a *server* configuration after a `PoolAgent` has successfully been registered.

See `eventHandlers.sample.js` for the template. To use, copy to a new file: `eventHandlers.js`, and add your
own logic inside the defined callbacks. The pool server will automatically include this file if it exists.
